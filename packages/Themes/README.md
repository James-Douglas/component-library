# Themes

## Installation

`yarn add @comparethemarketau/manor-themes`


## Documentation

Exports themes. Currently this only the CTM theme (`ctmTheme`), however in future whitelabel
themes can be added and exported alongside. You can import the ctmTheme, customize it as necessary (bearing in mind it should
be compliant with the design system) and pass the modified theme to the 
[ManorProvider component](../Provider/README.md)
