# Label

## Installation

`yarn add @comparethemarketau/manor-label`

## Documentation

The Label component is automatically included in components that need to be rendered with a label (e.g inputs, checkboxes, etc).

If, for some reason, you need to use this component in isolation, see the 
[component source](https://github.com/comparethemarketau/manor-react/blob/master/packages/Label/Label.component.js) 
for detailed prop documentation.
