## Development
### TLDR;

- `yarn build` - runs the build

## Releasing
Releasing is done by Bamboo using the semantic-release package. To trigger a release of the manor library you must merge a feature branch to Master

## Setting up  Private NPM Token
The variable bamboo_nexus_fe_token_password is used to authenticate with Nexus, this can be generated by performing the command `npm adduser --registry=https://nexus.comparethemarket.com.au/repository/platform-packages/` and following the prompts.

Locally this can be exported as an env far and specified in your shell: `export bamboo_nexus_fe_token_password=<YOUR_TOKEN>` where YOUR_TOKEN will look like: `1234567e-89aa-1a23-4567-ab12cd3e4fg5`

## Adding icons

### CTM icons

For icons that have been developed in house, you will need to extract the paths and the viewBox from the .svg file and add them
to `src/components/Icon/icons.js`.

### FontAwesome icons

For FontAwesome icons simply import and export them within `src/components/Icon/icons.js` as per the other examples.
