# Manor component Library
Design system component library for CTM - tested on Node v10.17.0

## Usage

### Installation

`yarn add @comparethemarketau/manor`

Wrap your app in the ManorProvider & import styles

```
import { ManorProvider } from '@comparethemarketau/manor/lib';
import '@comparethemarketau/manor/styles.css';

const App = () => (
  <ManorProvider>
    ... your app here
  </ManorProvider>
);
```

Import components as required

```
import { Header, Footer } from '@comparethemarketau/manor/lib'

render = () => (
  <>
    <Header />
    <Footer />
  </>
);
```

Additionally you can use various hooks by importing them the same way, where available

## Development

- `yarn storybook` - runs storybook for development
- `yarn test` - runs the tests
- `yarn tdd` - runs the tests with logs
- `yarn lint` - runs the linter
- `yarn build` - runs the build
- `yarn commit` - runs git-cz

### Using your local Manor within another project

You might find yourself wanting to pull in your changes to a project using Manor without having to do release (e.g to 
validate that a fix works). This can be done via `yarn link` (or `npm link`):

1. Link `react`, `react-dom` and `styled-components` from the project using Manor, 
*(This is important because it prevents multiple copies of the above libraries being present at runtime, which causes 
things to break and can be confusing to debug)*:
    * `cd /path/to/your_project/node_modules/react && yarn link`
    * `cd /path/to/your_project/node_modules/react-dom && yarn link`
    * `cd /path/to/your_project/node_modules/styled-components && yarn link`
2. In Manor, use the linked libraries from step 1:
    * `cd /path/to/manor-react && yarn link react && yarn link react-dom && yarn link styled-components`
3. Rebuild Manor
    * `cd /path/to/manor-react && yarn build`
4. Link the manor library
    * `cd /path/to/manor-react && yarn link`
5. Link Manor in your project
    & `cd /path/to/your_project && yarn link @comparethemarketau/manor`     

### Setting up Private NPM Token
The variable bamboo_nexus_fe_token_password is used to authenticate with Nexus, this can be generated by performing the command `npm adduser --registry=https://nexus.comparethemarket.com.au/repository/platform-packages/` and following the prompts.

Locally this can be exported as an env variable and specified in your shell: `export bamboo_nexus_fe_token_password=<YOUR_TOKEN>` where YOUR_TOKEN will look like: `1234567e-89aa-1a23-4567-ab12cd3e4fg5`
                            
### FontAwesome icons
We have access to pro icons within the font awesome library. For this, you'll need to add an env variable to your machine in the format of `NPM_FONTAWESOME_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>` where YOUR_TOKEN will look like `1234567e-89aa-1a23-4567-ab12cd3e4fg5`

UX holds the account information for [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com), where you can log in and grab the key (Pro npm Package Token in account settings). When set up, import as usual e.g

```
  import { faInfoCircle } from '@fortawesome/pro-regular-svg-icons';

```

Check the react package for more usage examples [here](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome)

## Whitelabeling
Whitelabeling can be achieved via theming and Manor has been developed with this capability. 

### Using a theme

The easiest way to theme is to import the base (CTM) theme, override variables as desired, then pass the modified theme to `ManorProvider`:

```
//app.js
import theme from '@comparethemarketau/manor/lib/themes';

theme.colors.primary50 = '#3deb34';
theme.accordion.background = 'red';
theme.borders.component = '2px solid yellow';

<ManorProvider theme={theme}>
    <App />
</ManorProvider>
```
