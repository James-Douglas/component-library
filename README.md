## Manor component Library
Desigin system component library for CTM - tested on Node v10.17.0

### TLDR;

- `yarn test` - runs the tests
- `yarn lint` - runs the linter

## Releasing
Releasing is done by Bamboo using the semantic-release package. To trigger a release of the manor library you must merge a feature branch to Master

## Setting up  Private NPM Token
The variable NPM_TOKEN is used to authenticate with Nexus, this can be generated by performing the command `npm adduser --registry=https://nexus.comparethemarket.com.au/repository/platform-packages/` and following the prompts.

Locally this can be exported as an env far and specified in your shell: `export NPM_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>` where YOUR_TOKEN will look like: `1234567e-89aa-1a23-4567-ab12cd3e4fg5`

On Bamboo this is set up in the environment variables of the build task: NPM_TOKEN=${bamboo_nexus_fe_token_password}
