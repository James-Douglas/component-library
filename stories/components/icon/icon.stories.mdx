# Icons

For icons we use Font Awesome with the pro licence, so all icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) are available to use **with UX approval**.

To use the pro icons, you'll need an auth key. This can be found in our FontAwesome account (UX can provide login/auth key)

To setup, you'll need this in your .npmrc file:

```
@fortawesome:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
//npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken=${NPM_FONTAWESOME_TOKEN}
```
Then you'll need to set an environment variable with the auth key, e.g `export NPM_FONTAWESOME_TOKEN=*fontawesome_auth_key_here*` in your terminal.
