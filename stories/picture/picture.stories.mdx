# Picture

Responsive picture component, designed to fit within it's containing element.

**Please note: Design/UX is working on improvements to this component, including providing sizing definitions and approved image types.**

This component renders a `<picture>` tag, which contains `<source>` elements (passed in via the `srcsets` prop), and an
`<img>` element (passed in via the `src` prop)  in order to cater to different display/device scenarios. Browsers will
consider each `<source>` element and choose the best match based on the media query provided, if none are found (or the
browser doesn't support the `<picture>` element, such as IE11) it will fall back to the `<img>` element.
