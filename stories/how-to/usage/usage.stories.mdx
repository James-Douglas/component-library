# Usage

#### ManorProvider

ManorProvider's primary purpose is to provide a Theme to Manor components. Additionally, it contains logic for interaction
tracking (used by Manor components), and for convenience you can use it to get breakpoint information.

`yarn add @comparethemarketau/manor-provider`

Within your application, ManorProvider needs to be higher in the component tree than any components you intend on using.  Typically, this means wrapping
your application with ManorProvider as such:


```
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { ManorProvider, ManorContext } from '@comparethemarketau/manor-provider';

const App = () => {
  const { breakpoint, isDesktop } = useContext(ManorContext);
  return (
    <ManorProvider>
      ... your app here
    </ManorProvider>
  );
}
```

#### Import components as required

```
import { Header } from '@comparethemarketau/manor-header';
import { Footer } from '@comparethemarketau/manor-footer';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <>
    <Header />
    <Footer />
  </>
);
```
