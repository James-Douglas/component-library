# Development

## Package management

The manor repository is a lerna/yarn workspace monorepo - please ensure you only use yarn as your package manager.

## Common commands

- `yarn storybook` - runs storybook for development
- `yarn test` - runs the tests (this is actually a CI version used on bamboo, for development see `yarn tdd`)
- `yarn tdd` - runs the tests with logs
- `yarn lint` - runs the linter
- `yarn build` - runs the build
- `yarn commit` - runs git-cz - we rely on commit message formatting so all commits should be run via this command.

## Committing

Please use `yarn commit` to commit, this command runs `git-cz` which will guide your through committing to ensure
it is properly formatted.

Be sure to check out the
[Contribution guidelines for this project](https://github.com/comparethemarketau/manor-react/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
before your first commit!

## Merging your changes

To ensure that your feature triggers a release of the library, please format your merge commit with the following
structure (using `yarn commit` will guide you through this):

`feat(componentName): change summary/ticket number here`

You can then remove the description field, and merge your changes

## Pipeline

[Bamboo build plan](https://bamboo.comparethemarket.com.au/browse/APUI-MFB)

### Feature branches

Navigate to the manor build plan (above) and enable your branch (if necessary). A second step ("Deploy Feature Instance")
can be run once a build has completed to deploy a feature branch. The feature branch will be accessible at
`http://<ticket>.dev.comparethemarket.cloud/` (e.g. `http://sml-1504.dev.comparethemarket.cloud/`).

Like all CTM feature branches, this relies on correct branch naming (`feature/<ticket>-<description>`)
