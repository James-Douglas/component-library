# Personally Identifiable Information (PII) & Personal Credit Information (PCI) Compliance
A number of Manor components have a prop, `gtmPidAnonymous`, that can be used to indicate the field is used to collect personally identifiable information. When using such components, be sure to set this to `true` so that a css class is added to the component that informs tracking software that it should obfuscate its contents.
When adding new components to Manor, be sure to consider if it could potentially be used to capture PII/PCI and if so, include this functionality in it's implementation.
