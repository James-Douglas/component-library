# Using Manor packages locally in another project

You might find yourself wanting to pull in your changes to a project using Manor without having to do release (e.g to
validate that a fix works). This can be done via `yarn link` (or `npm link`):

1. Link `react`, `react-dom` and `styled-components` from the project using Manor,
*(This is important because it prevents multiple copies of the above libraries being present at runtime, which causes
things to break and can be confusing to debug)*:
 * `cd /path/to/your_project/node_modules/react && yarn link`
 * `cd /path/to/your_project/node_modules/react-dom && yarn link`
 * `cd /path/to/your_project/node_modules/styled-components && yarn link`
2. In Manor, use the linked libraries from step 1:
 * `cd /path/to/manor-react/packages/PackageToBuild`
 * `yarn link react && yarn link react-dom && yarn link styled-components`
3. Rebuild Manor Packages
 * run `yarn build` within the package you wish to test
4. Link the build package
* Copy the packages package.json file into the lib folder (from within the `manor-react/packages/PackageToBuild` directory): `cp ./package.json ./lib/package.json`
* `cd lib`
* `yarn link`
5. Link the Manor package in your project
* `cd /path/to/your_project`
* `yarn link @comparethemarketau/manor-<YourPackageHere>`
