# Interaction tracking

Interaction tracking has been implemented in Manor for a number of components that CX wish to gain insights
for (things like focus, click, input events). These components now have a mandatory `trackingLabel` prop which is a
contextually relevant label used to identify the page element being tracked - e.g. an inputs label. We can't
just use an input's label as it either may not be present, or may not be a simple string.

ManorProvider defines a tracking dispatch action when it detects the `window.CtMDataLayer.` object, which vertical
applications make available through adding a tracking script to their `index.html`. It also makes a tracking function
`trackInteraction` available to components, which components then use when tracking specific events:

```
e.g.

const handleFocus = () => {
  trackInteraction('Focus', 'Component', 'Component', trackingLabel, value);
}


trackInteraction(action: string, object: string, type: string, label: string, value: any)
```

## Implementing tracking in new components

CX should include tracking requirements as Acceptance Criteria for any new components. The exact implementation will
depend highly on the component being implemented, but existing components should serve as a useful guide.

One thing to note is that often we want to debounce events so we aren't spamming the datalayer with information that isn't
useful. (e.g. Marketing/CX want to know that "abcd" was input in a single event, not an event each time a character is
input "a", "ab", "abc", "abcd").

### Testing tracking in storybook

To be able to test interaction tracking in storybook, we added a GTM tracking script into storybook, which is linked
to a specific GTM environment for manor testing. This has been done in `.storybook/index.override.ejs` which is an override
template for the main storybook container.

By default this script is only injected when the NODE_ENV is production (i.e. in the built storybook that runs on dev). To
enable it locally, run storybook as such `NODE_ENV=production yarn storybook`

You can verify interaction tracking events by directly inspecting `window.CtMDataLayer` in Storybook's console (select the
actual stories iframe), or with a browser extension like dataslayer.
