# Grid

## Containers

Containers provide a means to center and horizontally pad your site’s contents. Use Container for a responsive pixel
width or FluidContainer for width: 100% across all viewport and device sizes.

## Row

Rows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between
them. This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins. This way, all the content in your columns is
visually aligned down the left side.

### Alignment

### Column

- In a grid layout, content must be placed within columns and only columns may be immediate children of rows.
- Thanks to flexbox, grid columns without a specified width will automatically layout as equal width columns. For
example, four instances of .col-sm will each automatically be 25% wide from the small breakpoint and up. See the
auto-layout columns section for more examples.
- Column classes indicate the number of columns you’d like to use out of the possible 12 per row. So, if you want
three equal-width columns across, you can use .col-4.
- Column widths are set in percentages, so they’re always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.
- Columns have horizontal padding to create the gutters between individual columns, however, you can remove the margin
from rows and padding from columns with .no-gutters on the .row.
- To make the grid responsive, there are five grid breakpoints, one for each responsive breakpoint: all breakpoints
(extra small), small, medium, large, and extra large.
- Grid breakpoints are based on minimum width media queries, meaning they apply to that one breakpoint and all those
above it (e.g., .col-sm-4 applies to small, medium, large, and extra large devices, but not the first xs breakpoint).
