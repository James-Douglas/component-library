                Car insurance protects you against financial loss for damages resulting from car accidents, theft, weather
                events and other unforeseen costs according to your policy type. A car insurance policy helps pay for the cost
                of damage to cars, property, and even people.

                It can cover you if you cause personal injury in an accident or if you damage property or another vehicle. If
                 you opt for a higher level of coverage, you may also be covered for the repair or replacement costs of your
                 vehicle as a result of collisions, fire, theft, and weather events. Most policies will vary in coverage (and
                 price), which is why itâ€™s important to review your options carefully.
